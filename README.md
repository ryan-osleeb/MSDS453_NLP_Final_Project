Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to financial news headlines to extract sentiment and key narratives, which are then used as exogenous inputs in an ARIMAX model to forecast market returns for SPY (the S&P 500 ETF). The pipeline includes data preprocessing, sentiment analysis with FINBERT, semantic clustering with SentenceTransformer and tâ€‘SNE, and time series forecasting with ARIMAX.
